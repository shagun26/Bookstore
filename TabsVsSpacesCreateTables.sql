The reading is fascinating. For the first time I have been able to grasp the meaning of the various scientific theories developed since Einstein Theory of Relativity. There is great clarity and honesty in Hawking approach, specifying which concepts and theories have been already observed and therefore confirmed in their validity and which ones are still, although very probable, at the level of supposition. The books speaks about the origins, the formation and the probable future of our universe, explains the concepts of space and time and speaks of many other happenings among the stars, like black holes, etc.');
